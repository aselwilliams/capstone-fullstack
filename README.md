## Bakery E-commerce Project
Hello! My name is Asel Williams. This is my capstone project for DevMountain foundations course. This project was inspired by my passion for baking.

It allows users to order freshly baked goods quickly and easily. It will also save them time by providing a service to help with birthday parties and other celebrations.

The application consists of 3 layers: server, database and user interface. The tech stack is JS, HTML, CSS, Express.js, Sequelize, bit.io, axios, bcrypt, JWT, Stripe API, Email.js and gsap.
